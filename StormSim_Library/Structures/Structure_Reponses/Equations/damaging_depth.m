SOFTWARE NAME:
    Damaging_Depth_11_27_24.m

DESCRIPTION:
    Function to compute damaging depth as the total water column height from 
    the topographic surface to the peak of the controlling wave height.
    Damaging depth = SWL+0.7*Hc
    The controlling wave height, Hc, is defined as the average height of the highest 
    1-percent of waves during storm conditions. It is limited to the theoretical 
    breaker limit using Goda's breaker equation. 70 percent of the controlling 
    wave height is assumed to lie above the SWL. This approach assumes that SWL includes 
    all storm water level components including surge, tide, and wave setup. 
    Ks is sheltering coefficient: 1 for 0-1 rows, 0.7 for 2-3 rows, 0.5 for 4-5 rows, 0.3 for≥6 rows

INPUT/OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
    DamDepthEelev: damaging depth elevation
    DamDepth: damaging depth
    SPdepth: datum depth of save point
    Hm0: zero moment significant wave height
    Tp:  peak wave period
    SWL: total water level
    tanbeta: bottom slope
    Ks: Shielding parameter
        1 for 0 - 1 rows of buildings
        0.7 for 2 - 3 rows of buildings
        0.5 for 5 - 5 rows of buildings
        0.3 for >= 6 rows of buildings
